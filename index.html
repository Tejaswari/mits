    <p style="color:blue;">COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered strain of coronavirus, a type of virus known to cause respiratory infections in humans. This new strain was unknown before December 2019, when an outbreak of a pneumonia of unidentified cause emerged in Wuhan, China.</p></td><td style="text-align:right;"><marquee behaviour="scroll" direction="down"><img src="https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2020/03/30/899772-coronavirus-6.jpg?itok=jlGrcV-T" height="80px" width="80px"></td></tr></table></header><br>
    <h2 style="color:brown;"><b><u>HOW DID COVID-19 BEGINS?</u></b></h2>
    <table><tr><td><p style="color: blue;">It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. There is no evidence yet to link an intermediate animal reservoir, such as a pangolin, to its introduction to humans.

The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS-CoV-2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. Epidemiological studies estimate each infection results in 1.4 to 3.9 new ones when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures taken.</p></td><td><img src="https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/03/13145613/WCS1.jpg" height="150px" width="90px"></td></tr></table>

			<h2 style="color:brown;">Who is most at risk?</h2>
    <p style="color:blue;">People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.</p><br><div style="height: 220px;width: 300px;border: 5px;overflow: auto"><img src="https://www.illustrationsof.com/royalty-free-senior-citizens-clipart-illustration-1167634.jpg"></div></header><br>

This will allow the office to collect information and offer you guidance on next steps. To diagnose you, your doctor may run tests to rule out other common infections</p><br>
